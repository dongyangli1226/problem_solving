//Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm (below From geeksforgeeks)
//loop through only number of set bits time, unlike the first approach go through every bits
//Subtraction of 1 from a number toggles all the bits (from right to left) till the rightmost set bit(including the rightmost set bit).
//So if we subtract a number by 1 and do bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the rightmost set bit.
//If we do n & (n-1) in a loop and count the no of times loop executes we get the set bit count.
//The beauty of this solution is the number of times it loops is equal to the number of set bits in a given integer.
//O(logn)
